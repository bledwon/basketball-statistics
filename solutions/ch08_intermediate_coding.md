# Chapter 8 — Intermediate Coding & Next Steps

I did not find a formal **End of Chapter Exercises** section for Chapter 8 in the PDF. This chapter is more conceptual (workflow, feedback loops, project mindset).

If you want practice items here, I can add a short checklist + mini‑project (e.g., refactor a script into functions, add logging, and write a README).
