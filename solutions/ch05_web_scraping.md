# Chapter 5 — Web Scraping and APIs (Exercises)

I did not find an explicit **End of Chapter Exercises** section for Chapter 5 in this PDF. If you want, I can add a small practice exercise here (e.g., scrape a single HTML table and save as CSV) using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` in Python.

If you’d like that, tell me the target site or dataset and I’ll implement it.
